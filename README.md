# Autoclicker
#### Click using mouse movement

A long time ago I used to use this software which clicks for you when you stop moving your mouse to reduce clicking fatigue which I can find anymore. So I made a simple one in AutoIt.

### Operation:
- Clicks the left mouse button when your mouse stops moving
- It has a hard coded 150ms delay which is found most optimal
- To toggle clicking use backtick ( \` ) (Left top corner of keyboard)
- Useful tip: You can also enable visual notification on click in Windows by going to WinKey+R (Run) > main.cpl > "Pointer Options" tab > Check "Show location of pointer when I press CTRL key"
- If you are on a while you are at it you could also change the mouse pointer to black if you have a while windows theme (default) to help with mouse visibility
